## General Requirements 

|Code|Description|DevOpsML match|
|----|-----------|--------------|
|RG1|Support for the modeling of different aspects|PlatformMM allows to model the platform in all its parts. Every aspect can be modeled with specific metamodels, included in the PlatformMM instance |
|RG2|Support for model integration|Requirement satisfied by the integration mechanism provided by LinkingMM and ModeLink|
|RG3|Support for tool integration|LinkingMM allows to model the integration between all tools specified in the instance of PlatformMM|
|RG4|Support for customization|Engineers can model their platform according to their needs choosing languages, tools and concerns known by PlatformMM. They can also assemble a new workflow using existing elements in Spem catalogs|
|RG5|Support for different viewpoints and perspectives|Future Work: performing model transformations from a linking model, it is possible to generate complex and integrated views for different viewpoints and perspectives|

## Description Requirements 

|Code|Description|DevOpsML match|
|----|-----------|--------------|
|RD1|Use of appropriate modeling techniques|Engineers can choose their languages and include them into PlatformMM |
|RD2|Description of the flow|DevOpsML foresees the use of one or more modeling technique, without prescribing a concrete one. Every  MDE workflow metamodel is perfectly pluggable. An experiment with SPEM has already been done.|
|RD3|Specification of real-time properties|Future Work|
|RG4|Specification of people (roles), methods and tools|SPEM allows these specifications|


## Analysis and Simulation Requirements 

|Code|Description|DevOpsML match|
|----|-----------|--------------|
|RA1|Identification of constraints|Future Work|
|RA2|Configurability of constraint analysis|Future Work|
|RA3|Open to the addition of new analysis and simulation techniques|Future Work|
|RA4|Support for time-based analysis and simulation|Future Work|
|RA5|Investigation and evaluation of different alternatives|Future Work|
|RA6|Support for tool and technology migration analysis|Future Work|
